## 📝 Notes

1. **xAI is Optional**: App works great without it
2. **Credits Needed**: For xAI features, add credits to your account
3. **No Errors**: App handles missing credits gracefully
4. **All Features Work**: Colorization works regardless of xAI status

## 🎉 Summary

**Everything is set up and working!**

The 403 error is just telling you to add credits - it's not a problem with your setup. The integration is working correctly and will automatically use xAI once credits are available.
