   - Error: Model files need to be downloaded
   - Expected: Best quality once model files are available

INTERPRETATION
--------------
- SSIM (0-1): Higher is better, measures structural similarity
- PSNR (dB): Higher is better, measures image quality
- MSE: Lower is better, measures error
- Color Variance: Higher means more color variation
- Color Diversity: Higher means more distinct colors

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. For Speed: Use Professional Gradient (0.0087s)
2. For Color Diversity: Use Demo Colorization
3. For Quality: Use Professional Gradient (SSIM: 1.000, PSNR: 39.02 dB)
4. For Best Results: Download AI model files for AI Colorization
